Step 1: Create workflow directory and file

In your project root, create this path:

.github/workflows/main.yml

Step 2: Add the following workflow code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

# Trigger workflow on push or pull request to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# Define workflow jobs
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # 1️⃣ Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2️⃣ Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      # 3️⃣ Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # 4️⃣ Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test --if-present

      # 5️⃣ Build the project
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # 6️⃣ (Optional) Upload build artifacts for inspection
      - name: Upload production build
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: production-build
          path: build/

  # Optional: Deploy job (only runs if build succeeds)
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Example deployment to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
